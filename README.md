<h1 align="center">Hello :)</h1>

I mainly code in **Python**, but I've done some projects on **Java** aswell<br>
My mother language is **Spanish**, but I also speak **English**. At this point I would've been able to speak **Esperanto** if Duolingo wasn't so _bad_ at making decisions 🦉 <br>
One time I made a script that shuts down your computer and accidentally ran it <br>
