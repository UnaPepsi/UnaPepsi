I mainly code in **Python**, but I've done some (small) projects on **Java** and **C#**. I never used an Apple product and don't plan on doing so 🍎 <br>
My mother language is **Spanish**, I also speak (not C1) **English**. At this point I would've been able to speak **Esperanto** if Duolingo wasn't so shit at making decisions 🦉 <br>
One time I made a script that shuts down your computer and accidentally ran it. My goal in life is to not work at McDonald's 🍟

I've made some projects for fun and learning:
* Discord bot (gm20 & ReminderBot)🐍
* Clash Royale bot🐍
* PC game (rats invaders)🐍
* Web Scrapping & API Integrations🐍
* HCF MacroSwitcher🐍
* Mobile game (rats invaders)  <img src="https://cdn3.emoji.gg/emojis/7106-csharp.png" width="20px" height="20px" alt="CSharp"></a>
* Simple Minecraft Plugin☕
